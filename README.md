# bristolbronies
Despite merely being a group that organises social events for horse show fans, we have persistently held openness, transparency, and democracy to be core values of our organisation. From our [organisational documentation](http://bristolbronies.co.uk/about/documentation/) being free for anyone to read, to our [entire history of financial transactions](http://bristolbronies.co.uk/donate/) being available online.

This openness is now translating to our code. Hosted in public on GitHub, it gives people unprecedented access into the things that make our organisation tick. 

Feel free to read, learn from, and fork our code.
